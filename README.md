## Development
 - Use loglevel for logging (https://github.com/pimterry/loglevel) 
```
import * as log from "loglevel"
log.warn("ultra-compatible")
 ```
  - Change available Blockly-blocks in Editor's render method. List of blocks by type can be found _here_ https://github.com/google/blockly/tree/master/blocks
